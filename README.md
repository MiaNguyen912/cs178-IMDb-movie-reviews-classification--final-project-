# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model classifies movie reviews into **positive** or **negative** sentiment categories based on the text content.

## Key Features:
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the IMDB dataset, containing 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.
- **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and tokenized, with stopwords removed and text normalized.
- **Modeling**: Implements a machine learning model using a **Bag of Words (BoW)** vectorizer to convert text into numerical features, followed by training a classification model.
- **Evaluation**: The performance is evaluated on a test set, and the model's accuracy is tracked to assess its ability to predict sentiment accurately.

## Techniques Used:
- **Text preprocessing** (removing stop words, tokenization, lemmatization)
- **TF-IDF** vectorization
- Model evaluation using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**

## Classifiers:
- KNN
- Logistic regression
- Neural Network
- 
## Objective:
This project aims to demonstrate how basic NLP techniques can be used to classify movie reviews, providing insights into how sentiment analysis can be applied to textual data.
